Regression :
    Regression is a method for understanding the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome.
    Outcomes can then be predicted once the relationship between independent and dependent variables has been estimated.

usages :
    In practice, a model will be trained on labelled data to understand the relationship between data features and the dependent variable.
     By estimating this relationship, the model can predict the outcome of new and unseen data.
     This could be used to predict missing historic data, and estimate future outcomes too.
     In a sales environment, an organisation could use regression machine learning to predict the next month’s sales from a number of factors.
     In a medical environment, an organisation could forecast health trends in the general population over a period of time.


Linear Regression :
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning.
It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables.
It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.
Different regression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables they are considering, and the number of independent variables getting used.
